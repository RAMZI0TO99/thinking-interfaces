# Thinking Interfaces

A reproducible EEG motor-imagery research project investigating how pretrained
representations and adaptation methods behave with small target support sets.
Engineering correctness, scientific validity and useful real-time interaction
are separate goals.

The project currently focuses on the Cho2017 five-shot comparison: LaBraM linear
probing, LoRA, full tuning and EEGNet, across51 evaluation targets and five seeds.
The available source cohort contains52 subjects. The planned first tranche has
1,020 evaluation cells; **zero accepted final scientific cells are complete**.

## Start here

- [Current handoff and next step](HANDOFF.md)
- [Project plan, progress and literature review](docs/where%20are%20we/README.md)
- [Project execution policy](docs/PROJECT_EXECUTION_POLICY.md)
- [Same-project agent coordination](AGENT_COORDINATION.md)
- [Windows setup](WINDOWS_SETUP.md) and [continuation guide](CONTINUE_HERE.md)

Work is scheduled and reviewed within this project. Root handles local admission
under the owner's scope and the resource/cleanup rules in the execution policy.

## Engineering progress

The provenance-aware restoration factory, parent/numerical-worker composition
and metadata boundary have scoped engineering qualifications. P3 metadata/profile
and telemetry sources are implemented and statically reviewed.

The [local validation contract](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_local_validation_contract_20261029.md)
has independent design acceptance. It binds 117 candidate cases, 34 successor
controls and 26 qualification scenarios to separate qualification, preparation,
loader/collection, validation and closeout stages. The two retired shared-window
controls are explicitly replaced by local-window controls.

The [P2 dependency map and file-only caller](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_dependency_preparation_20261029.md) have accepted Q10 qualification (198 methods, eight UTC controls, two native fault controls and three sharing checks) and accepted P10 physical preparation: 20,406 files, 888 native images and 4,843 dependency edges. The 105.32-second run completed full final input verification and owned cleanup. Earlier failures and unknown cleanup remain frozen; physical preparation does not qualify loader/ABI behavior.

The [L observer and collection implementation](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_loader_implementation_20261031.md) is independently source-reviewed. Fresh Q2 qualification accepted 356 methods, eight UTC controls, two fault controls, three sharing checks and five native observer cases with owned cleanup. P2 proposed coverage is reviewed (20,798 files), but its fresh attempt stopped during startup; physical preparation is not accepted and explicit caller/guard/journal closure is UNPROVEN. A bounded startup diagnostic or successor must be reviewed before another unchanged P admission. The finite L plan and full 40-scenario qualification remain incomplete; L collection, the 117 candidates and 34 successor controls remain unexecuted.

The [accepted v8 inventory](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_inventory_observation_20261029.md)
remains a 742-file current-byte observation with 19 passing tests. The 117
candidate tests and 34 successor controls remain unexecuted. Bootstrap004 stays
consumed, diagnostics005 held, custody UNRESOLVED and006 unadmitted. Scientific
cells remain0/1020. The new scoped policy replacement takes effect only through
implementation-specific adoption; the full-restart claim remains unchanged.

## Research and evidence

[The project plan](docs/where%20are%20we/PROJECT_PLAN.md) explains the first tranche
and wider research program. [The literature review](docs/where%20are%20we/LITERATURE_REVIEW.md)
covers the datasets, models and previous studies.
[The evidence index](docs/where%20are%20we/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md) distinguishes static
review, executed engineering checks and scientific decisions.

Gate A is accepted only under the owner's retrospective amendment. The final
scientific freeze remains unsigned. No engineering pass establishes predictive
performance, checkpoint independence or completion of the study.

## Repository layout

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `core/`, `configs/` | Contracts, configuration, run records, metrics and gates |
| `encoder/` | LaBraM loading and representation controls |
| `adaptation/` | Episodic adaptation, LoRA, adapters and prompts |
| `data/` | Dataset loaders, channel mapping and preprocessing |
| `evaluation/` | Baselines, leakage checks, statistics and figures |
| `realtime/` | Causal buffering, LSL, abstention and interface |
| `docs/phase2/` | Designs, versioned candidates and dated engineering reports |
| `evidence/` | Published source and metadata packets |
| `tools/migration/` | Verified Windows restoration tooling |

Raw recordings, processed signals, selected weights, runtime environments and
live run trees are not ordinary Git payloads. Historical receipts remain dated
evidence; a fresh clone needs authenticated assets and current runtime checks.

The previous long status pages are preserved in the
[documentation archive](docs/history/project_focus_20261028/README.md).
Current operational rules come from the active handoff and policy.
