# Coordination within this project

Effective 28 October 2026, Asia/Riyadh. The owner has selected exclusive focus on
Thinking Interfaces. This page governs collaboration inside this project.

Root owns planning, scheduling, admission and the handoff. Active work does not
depend on another project, external chat response, shared lease or outside
decision. Do not message or poll other project chats unless the owner asks.

Read [the execution policy](docs/PROJECT_EXECUTION_POLICY.md) for local admission
and [the handoff](HANDOFF.md) for current engineering status.

## Roles and file ownership

- Root assigns one bounded task and explicit file ownership to each subagent.
- For current work, use Root plus one author or one independent reviewer at a
  time. Preserve other agents' changes and hand ownership over explicitly.
- Reviewers must not certify their own implementation. Source review and actual
  result review are separate; both stay inside this project.
- Routine documentation and static inspection need no compute window.

## Execution workflow

Root records the exact operation, fresh pins, applicable local resource limits,
unused output directory, local stop control and reviewed cleanup obligations.
The independently reviewed runner must match that contract. Review actual
caller return, child/Job closure and complete saved evidence before accepting a
result. An expected artifact or a successful metadata command is not proof of
an executed operation or physical cleanup.

Legacy scheduling and outside approval dependencies are retired. Frozen scripts
and receipts retain their bytes; replace incompatible dependencies in a new
successor instead of inventing old-format grants or editing historical outcomes.

## Current task boundary

The [local validation contract](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_local_validation_contract_20261029.md)
has independent design acceptance. It binds 117 candidate cases, 34 successor
controls and 26 qualification scenarios to separate qualification, preparation,
loader/collection, validation and closeout stages. The two retired shared-window
controls are explicitly replaced by local-window controls.

The [P2 dependency map and file-only caller](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_dependency_preparation_20261029.md) have accepted Q10 qualification (198 methods, eight UTC controls, two native fault controls and three sharing checks) and accepted P10 physical preparation: 20,406 files, 888 native images and 4,843 dependency edges. The 105.32-second run completed full final input verification and owned cleanup. Earlier failures and unknown cleanup remain frozen; physical preparation does not qualify loader/ABI behavior.

The [L observer and collection implementation](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_loader_implementation_20261031.md) is source-reviewed; its Q2 accepted 356 methods and scoped native controls. Its reviewed 20,798-file P2 proposal did not become accepted physical preparation: the earlier startup failure and UNPROVEN caller/guard/journal closure remain preserved.

The [startup diagnostic](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_startup_diagnostic_implementation_20261031.md) is implemented and independently accepted. Fresh SQ3 passed 124 methods, eight UTC controls, two native faults, eight syntax checks and eight real controller cases. Separately admitted D2 recorded the counter-constructor start marker but no completion marker before the five-second boundary; final verification and owned cleanup passed. This does not establish the earlier P failure's cause or cleanup.

Next is a reviewed P caller successor using the qualified native memory sensor, followed by applicable fresh Q qualification, refreshed P coverage and separately admitted physical preparation. The finite L plan and full 40-scenario qualification remain incomplete. L collection, the 117 candidate tests and 34 successor controls remain unexecuted; no unchanged P2 retry or automatic P grant follows.

The [accepted v8 inventory](docs/phase2/cho51_p3_inventory_observation_20261029.md)
remains a 742-file current-byte observation with 19 passing tests. The 117
candidate tests and 34 successor controls remain unexecuted. Bootstrap004 stays
consumed, diagnostics005 held, custody UNRESOLVED and006 unadmitted. Scientific
cells remain0/1020. The new scoped policy replacement takes effect only through
implementation-specific adoption; the full-restart claim remains unchanged.

Source and actual reviewers are distinct; Root adopts exact reviewed records.
The v8 observation rechecked10 source inputs,732 runtime files and572 preserved
predecessors. New workloads require their own scope and admission. The original
48-case matrix is not completed by these subset tests.

Historical coordination pages are preserved in the
[documentation archive](docs/history/project_focus_20261028/README.md).
They explain past events and do not impose current scheduling prerequisites.
